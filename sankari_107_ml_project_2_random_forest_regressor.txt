Gold_price_prediction:

1. In this project, we are going to see the good gold prices based on several other stock prices.

2. work-flow of this project:

Data set----->Data preprocessing----->Data Analysis(analysing the statitstical data, find correlation, distribtion details, etc)----->Train_test_split--->Random forest regressor---->evaluate the value

3.Loading the dataset

4.Data Preprocessing:

4.1 we read first some particular rows in the dataset.
4.2 check the shape, get some basic information about the dataset.
4.3 check the missing values
4.4 check the statistical measures of the data.
4.5 find the correlation by using heatmap.
4.6 check the distribution of the gold price

5. Data Analysis:(observation of the correlation map)
5.1 If the gold price increased, then the silver price also increased.
5.2 If USO(US oil fund) increased, then EUR/USD also increased

6.splitting the feature and targeted data

7. splitting the training and test data

8.Load the Randonforestregressor model
8.1 train the model
8.2 Randomforest model is an ensemble model, means it contains more than one model gether. 
8.3 It contains more than one decision tree. The majority of the voting of all the decision tree is the final result.

9.Evaluate the model score by r2_score is greater than 0.9 which is good accuracy score and we got the good model.
